--------Classes---------
------------------------

A class is a template for a data type. It describes the kinds of information that class will hold and how a programmer will interact with that data.  

----------------
Creating a Class
----------------
Naming: The PEP 8 Style Guide for Python (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#class-names) recommends the CapWords naming convention when identifying a Class. 

Defining: When defining a class, the 'pass' keyword can be used to indicate that the body of the class was intentionally left blank. This can also be a good time to document what the class is intended to do using the triple quote comment style.

	Instantiation: A class doesn’t accomplish anything simply by being defined. A class must be instantiated. In other words, we must create an instance of the class, in order to breathe life into the schematic. Instantiating a class looks a lot like calling a function. e.g: cool_instance = CoolClass()

		*note*: If a variable is reassigned to a different instance, the prior assignment will be a candidate for 'garbage collection' provided that there is no other variable pointing to it.

		A class instance is also called an 'object'. Instantiation takes a class and turns it into an object. When the type() function is called with an object, it returns the class that the object is an instance of.

	Class Variables: a variable defined within the body of the class. Used for when we want the same data to be available in every instance of a class. You can access all of an object's class variables with the 'object.variable' syntax

	Methods: functions that are defined as part of a class. Methods always have at least this one argument. The first argument in a method is always the object that is calling the method. Convention recommends that we name this first argument 'self'. 'self' is not a special keyword in python and can therefore be renamed. While it is recommended to stick to normal naming convention when regards to 'self', the argument can be renamed in favor of syntax highlighting.

	Constructors: There are several methods that we can define in a Python class that have special behavior. These methods are sometimes called “magic”, because they behave differently from regular methods. Another popular term is dunder methods, so-named because they have two underscores (double-underscore abbreviated to “dunder”) on either side of them.
		Constructors, much like methods, always have at least one argument (that returns the object calling the method) recommended to be called 'self'. Constructors can also take more then one argument that can be passed by the instantiation syntax of the object.

	Instance Variables: The data held by an object is referred to as an instance variable. Instance variables aren’t shared by all instances of a class — they are variables that are specific to the object they are attached to.

	Attribute Functions: If we attempt to access an attribute of an object (instance variable, class variable) that doesn't exist, it will throw an 'AttributeError'. To determine if a variable exists, we can use getattr() which will return the variable if it exists; or hasattr() which will return a boolean value

----------------------------
Inheritance and Polymorphism
----------------------------

If the bulk of a class’s definition is useful, but we have a new use case that is distinct from how the original class was used, we can inherit from the original class. We call this inheritance into a new class, 'a subclass'. You can create a subclass by passing a class's constructors into a new class as a parameter. Multiple classes can be passed into a subclass. This concept is known as 'multiple inheritance'.

Overriding Methods
Inheritance is a useful way of creating objects with different class variables, but is that all it’s good for? What if one of the methods needs to be implemented differently? In Python, all we have to do to override a method definition is to offer a new definition for the method in our subclass.

An overridden method is one that has a different definition from its parent class. What if User class didn’t have an is_admin flag but just checked if it had permission for something based on a permissions dictionary? It could look like this:

class User:
  def __init__(self, username, permissions):
    self.username = username
    self.permissions = permissions

  def has_permission_for(self, key):
    if self.permissions.get(key):
      return True
    else:
      return False

Above we defined a class User which takes a permissions parameter in its constructor. Let’s assume permissions is a dict. User has a method .has_permission_for() implemented, where it checks to see if a given key is in its permissions dictionary. We could then define our Admin user like this:

class Admin(User):
  def has_permission_for(self, key):
    return True


Here we define an Admin class that subclasses User. It has all methods, attributes, and functionality that User has. However, if you call has_permission_for on an instance of Admin, it won’t check its permissions dictionary. Since this User is also an Admin, we just say they have permission to see everything!

------------------------
--Constructors & Methods
------------------------

__init__ : this method is know as a 'Constructor' and is used to initialize a newly created object. It is called every time the class is instantiated. The __init__() method should either have no return statement at all (the most common and preferred usage) or it may have a return statement that returns the value None. If the method attempts to return a value other than None, Python will report the error “TypeError: __init__() should return None”. If the method needs to report an error condition, then an exception should be raised.

__repr__: this method is used to tell Python what we want the string representation of the class to be. __repr__ can only have one parameter, which is 'self' and must return a string. While you are allowed to include or exclude any information from the object that you want, the Python documentation recommends that the implementation for __repr__() should contain as much information as possible and if, at all possible, it should contain whatever is necessary to recreate the object.

__iter__:

__len__: a method set to return the length of the set parameters. Allows the class to be used with the len() syntax

__contains__: allows the use of the 'char in characters' syntax to check if a value exists inside of it



---------
--Types-- - otherwise known as primitives
---------

float: floating point numerical values. Values specified with a decimal point. Floats are returned when doing an operation on a set of integers

int: integers. fixed point numerical values

list: a list of types

dict: a list of keys and values

str: strings. sequences of character data

bool: Boolean values. Objects returned as True or False

complex: complex numbers are specified as '<real part>+<imaginary part>j'. e.g: >>>2+3j (2+3j) >>> type(2+3j) <class 'complex'> 

------------------------
--Functions & Syntax's--
------------------------

type(variable_name): check the type of variable

object.variable: used to return all of an object's class variables

getattr(object_name, variable_name, arg3(optional)): will return the variable if it exists, otherwise will throw an 'AttributeError'. Arg3 can be specified as a return if the variable doesn't exist. 

hasattr(object_name, variable_name): Similar to 'getattr()' however, returns a boolean value if the variable doesn't exist

dir(object_name): returns a list of an objects attributes at runtime
				- Python automatically adds a number of attributes to all objects that get created. These internal attributes are usually indicated by double-underscores.
				- dir() can also be used on Python's native data types; including functions!
		*note*  - the dir() call on the object of class Examine shows the instance variable created in the object while the call for the class does not. e.g: >>>class Examine:
						class_var = "This is a class variable"
						def __init__(self):
							self.inst_var = "This is an instance variable"
				  >>>myobj = Examine() 
				  >>>print(dir(Examine))
				  ['__doc__', '__init__', '__module__', 'class_var']
				  >>>print(dir(myobj))
				  ['__doc__', '__init__', '__module__', 'class_var', 'inst_var']

issubclass(baseclass, subclass): returns True value if arg1 is a subclass of arg2, and false if it's not. If either argument isn't a subclass, it 									 returns a TypeError.

super().methodName(args): gives us a proxy object. With this proxy object, we can invoke the method of an object’s parent class (also called its superclass).
