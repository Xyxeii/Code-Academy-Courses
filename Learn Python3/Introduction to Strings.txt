Introduction to Strings
-----------------------

Strings are used to store a sequence of characters. It can be any length and contain and letters, numbers, symbols and spaces. Strings can be thought of as a list of characters and therefore can be indexed as such. This is known as 'Slicing a String'. 

\ - can be used to escape a character. This is useful when attempt to use protected characters in a string. This does not add to the length of the string.

String Methods
--------------

Python comes with built-in string methods that gives you the power to perform complicated tasks on strings very quickly and efficiently. You can call multiple string methods in a single statement

eg:

.upper() : returns a string as all uppercase

.lower() : returns are string as all lowercase

.title() : returns a string while capatalizing the first letter of each word within the string

.split() : is performed on a string, takes one argument, and returns a list of substrings found between the given argument

.join() : the opposite of .split(). returns the contents of a list as a single string

.replace() : replaces all characters in arg1 with all characters in arg2

.strip() : removes all unnecessary spacing from a string

.format() : formats a string

.find() : returns the first index value where the string is located
