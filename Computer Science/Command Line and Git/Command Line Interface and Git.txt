Working Directory: where you’ll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files
Staging Area: where you’ll list changes you make to the working directory
Repository: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project
Untracked Files: Files that git recognizes but hasn't starting tracking changes for. 

commit: permanently stores changes from the staging area inside the repository
